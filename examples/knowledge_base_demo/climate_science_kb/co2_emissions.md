# CO2 Concentration and Emissions Research Context

## Atmospheric CO2 Key Findings

### Keeling Curve Legacy (1958-Present)

- Continuous measurements at Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958
- Pre-industrial baseline: ~280 ppm
- Current concentration (2024): ~425 ppm
- Annual increase: ~2.5 ppm/year (accelerating)

### Seasonal Cycle

The characteristic "sawtooth" pattern reflects:

- **Spring decline**: Northern Hemisphere vegetation uptake
- **Fall rise**: Decomposition releases CO2
- Amplitude: ~6-7 ppm at Mauna Loa
- Larger amplitude at high northern latitudes

## Key Literature Findings

### IPCC AR6 (2021-2023) Summary

- CO2 is the dominant driver of observed warming since 1850
- Approximately 50% of cumulative emissions remain in atmosphere
- Carbon budget for 1.5°C: ~400 GtCO2 remaining (from 2020)
- Net zero emissions required by 2050 for 1.5°C pathway

### Friedlingstein et al. (2023) - Global Carbon Budget

- Global CO2 emissions: ~40 GtCO2/year (fossil + land use)
- Ocean sink: ~11 GtCO2/year (26%)
- Land sink: ~12 GtCO2/year (30%)
- Atmospheric growth: ~17 GtCO2/year (44%)

## Emissions by Sector

| Sector                    | Share of Global Emissions |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Energy (electricity/heat) | 25%                       |
| Industry                  | 21%                       |
| Transport                 | 16%                       |
| Buildings                 | 18%                       |
| Agriculture & Land Use    | 18%                       |
| Other                     | 2%                        |

## Interpreting CO2 Visualizations

### Time Series Analysis

When analyzing CO2 concentration plots:

1. **Remove seasonal cycle** for trend analysis (deseasonalized data)
2. **Note rate of change**, not just absolute values
3. **Compare to emission pledges** (NDCs)
4. **Identify acceleration/deceleration** periods

### Relationship to Temperature

- CO2 forcing: ~5.35 × ln(C/C₀) W/m²
- Transient climate response: 1.0-2.5°C per CO2 doubling
- Equilibrium climate sensitivity: 2.5-4.0°C per CO2 doubling

### Key Thresholds

| CO2 Level | Significance                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 350 ppm   | "Safe" level (Hansen et al.)          |
| 400 ppm   | First crossed in 2013                 |
| 450 ppm   | Associated with 2°C warming pathway   |
| 500 ppm   | High-risk scenario                    |

## Data Sources and Quality

- **Mauna Loa**: Gold standard for atmospheric CO2 (±0.1 ppm accuracy)
- **Ice cores**: Historical reconstructions (±2 ppm for recent millennia)
- **Flask network**: Global spatial coverage (NOAA ESRL)
- **Satellites**: Column-integrated measurements (OCO-2, OCO-3)
