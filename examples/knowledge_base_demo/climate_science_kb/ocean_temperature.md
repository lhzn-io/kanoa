# Sea Surface Temperature Research Context

## Key Findings from Recent Literature

### Hansen et al. (2023) - Global Temperature Analysis

- Global surface temperature reached +1.2°C above pre-industrial levels
- Ocean warming accounts for ~90% of Earth's energy imbalance
- Arctic amplification: 2-3x faster warming than global average
- El Niño/La Niña cycles modulate year-to-year variability by ±0.2°C

### Cheng et al. (2024) - Ocean Heat Content

- Ocean absorbing approximately 90% of excess heat
- Heat penetrating to deeper ocean layers (>700m)
- Marine heatwaves increasing in frequency and duration
- Thermal expansion contributing to sea level rise

## Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Metrics

### Global SST Anomaly

- Primary indicator of ocean-atmosphere heat exchange
- Measured via satellites (AVHRR, MODIS) and buoys (Argo network)
- Typical uncertainty: ±0.1°C for satellite retrievals

### Regional SST Indices

| Index    | Region           | Climate Relevance         |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Niño 3.4 | Tropical Pacific | ENSO state indicator      |
| AMO      | North Atlantic   | Multi-decadal variability |
| PDO      | North Pacific    | Decadal oscillation       |
| IOD      | Indian Ocean     | Monsoon impacts           |

### Marine Heatwaves (MHWs)

Definition: SST exceeds 90th percentile for ≥5 consecutive days

Categories:

- **Moderate**: 1-2x threshold
- **Strong**: 2-3x threshold
- **Severe**: 3-4x threshold
- **Extreme**: >4x threshold

## Warming Trends by Ocean Basin

| Basin            | Trend (°C/decade) | Notes                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Arctic           | +0.3 to +0.5      | Fastest warming, ice-albedo feedback |
| North Atlantic   | +0.1 to +0.2      | AMOC variability influences trend    |
| Tropical Pacific | +0.1              | ENSO dominates interannual signal    |
| Southern Ocean   | +0.05 to +0.1     | Heat uptake into deep water          |

## Implications for Visualization Interpretation

When analyzing SST time series:

1. Look for long-term trend vs. interannual variability
2. Identify ENSO events (1997-98, 2015-16 El Niños are prominent)
3. Note acceleration in warming post-2000
4. Consider regional vs. global context
5. Recognize uncertainty in historical data (pre-satellite era)
